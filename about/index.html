<p>If you&rsquo;re a PM manager (have product managers reporting to you) and want a sounding board to get better at specific PM management challenges: hiring, retaining or growing people, org structure, developing or scaling the PM function, etc., I&rsquo;m happy to be one. Email me and we can find time. For all the craft PMs spend on products, we don&rsquo;t on our function and it is an area I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing improve.</p>
