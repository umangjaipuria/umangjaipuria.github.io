                </div></header><p>From <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3289-some-advice-from-jeff-bezos">Some advice from Jeff Bezos</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During one of his answers, he shared an enlightened observation about people who are “right a lot”.</p>
<p>He said people who were right a lot of the time were people who often changed their minds. He doesn’t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It’s perfectly healthy — encouraged, even — to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is one of the largest energy drains in an organization: convincing some people to change their minds who are resistant to sound reason and hard facts because they feel changing their stance will make them look stupid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related: many leaders and risk-takers have an ego and reputation to defend, and that leads them to only attempt things on a grand scale instead of starting small, learning quickly, and being agile. This usually comes at the cost to the team and of the business opportunity.</p>
